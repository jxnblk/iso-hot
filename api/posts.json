The Web is fluid - based on screens and devices of varying sizes – and typography on the Web should reflect that.\n\nSecond, design content-out, which usually means designing around a strong typographical base since the large majority of Web content and UI is text.\n\nAnd last, design with modular scales. Things built on the Web should be fluid and infinitely scalable. Using modular scales in a design compliments that idea and keeps things organized in the face of growing complexity.\n"},{"title":"Potatoes","id":2,"filename":"potatoes.md","date":"2015-08-03T02:21:10.068Z","content":"# Potatoes gonna potate\r\n\r\n![](http://media.giphy.com/media/auJjZlb3h1Ga4/giphy.gif)\n"},{"title":"What is this?","id":1,"filename":"what-is-iso-hot.md","date":"2015-08-01T00:00:00.000Z","content":"Universal is a universal JavaScript application that demonstrates a handful of related technologies, including:\n\n- [React](http://facebook.github.io/react/)\n- [React Hot Loader](https://gaearon.github.io/react-hot-loader/)\n- [Redux](https://github.com/gaearon/redux)\n- [react-router](http://rackt.github.io/react-router/)\n- [webpack](http://webpack.github.io/)\n- [Node Express](http://expressjs.com/)\n- [Babel](https://babeljs.io/)\n\nIt also is a simple demonstration of handling inline styles with React and Object-Based Interface Architecture with a RESTful API.\n"}]
